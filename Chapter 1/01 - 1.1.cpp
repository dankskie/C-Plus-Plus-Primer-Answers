// I recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio if you dont already have an IDE of choice.
// Start a new project under visual C++ and select Console App to get started.
// It saves files as .cpp as default.
// Pressing F5 runs your code.
// If it's not letting you run, try saving the project first; alternatively go to debug -> start debugging.
